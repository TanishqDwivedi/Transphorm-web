# Transphorm-web


Aim:

Designed a basic introductory website for the company to develop skills as a full-stack developer.

Implementation:

MERN(MongoDB,Express.js,React,Node.js) Stack framework was used to deploy this website. 

React:

Creating the dynamic client side application using HTML was done in React. React helped me build up complex interfaces 
through simple components,connect them to data on my back-end server, and render them as HTML.

Express.js/Node.js:

It acts as a middleware server side framework, running inside a Node.js server. It has a powerful models for matching an 
incoming URL with a server function and handling HTTP requests and responses. 

MongoDB:

A document based database which aligns easily with React, Node, and Express.  JSON documents created in React.js 
front end can be sent to the Express.js server, where it can be processed and stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval.
